## <a name="question"></a> Question

How should dependencies be managed and injected across architectural layers to support inversion of control, testability, and modular design?

## <a name="options"></a> Options

1. <a name="option-1"></a> Use manual dependency injection by explicitly wiring components during application startup.
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Use a lightweight dependency injection container or framework.
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Inject dependencies via global variables or service locators accessible throughout the application.

## <a name="criteria"></a> Criteria

- Clarity and visibility of wiring logic
- Adherence to inversion of control principle
- Ease of testing and substituting mocks or stubs
- Runtime flexibility and configurability
- Tooling support and learning curve
