## <a name="question"></a> Question

How should performance optimization for a specific workflow be implemented in a way that satisfies system requirements without compromising Clean Architecture principles?

## <a name="options"></a> Options

1. <a name="option-1"></a> Apply optimization techniques (e.g., caching, batching) in the outer Frameworks and Drivers layer only.
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Introduce optimization hooks into the use case layer with careful isolation from core entities.
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Embed optimization logic directly into core business logic for tighter integration and control.

## <a name="criteria"></a> Criteria

- Adherence to Clean Architecture boundaries
- Performance gains for the targeted workflow
- Complexity of implementation and debugging
- Risk of introducing coupling between layers
- Maintainability and testability post-optimization
