## <a name="question"></a> Question

How should data flow and transformation be structured during a specific interaction to ensure clarity, consistency, and clean separation between architectural layers?

## <a name="options"></a> Options

1. <a name="option-1"></a> Transform data at each layer boundary using dedicated DTOs or mappers to maintain layer independence.
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Use a shared representation across layers and rely on implicit transformation within service logic.
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Perform transformations at the infrastructure or adapter layer only, keeping core layers unaware of external formats.

## <a name="criteria"></a> Criteria

- Clarity and traceability of data as it flows through the system
- Separation of concerns between layers
- Maintainability of transformation logic
- Risk of tight coupling or duplication
